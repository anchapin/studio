## Copyright Notice

All Magic: The Gathering card images, card text, and game rules are property of Wizards of the Coast. This project does not host any copyrighted materials.

## Fair Use Statement

This project is designed to emulate a Magic: The Gathering tabletop experience for personal, non-commercial use. Similar projects like Cockatrice and XMage have operated for years under this model.

The project provides:
- A digital game board for playing MTG-format games
- Deck building and management tools
- AI-assisted gameplay features

We believe this falls under fair use as it:
- Is non-commercial in nature
- Does not substitute for official MTG products
- Is transformative in its purpose (a utility tool vs. a product)

- Support the official game and its creators
- Use this tool only for personal, educational purposes
