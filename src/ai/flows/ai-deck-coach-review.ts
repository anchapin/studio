**Format:** {{{format}}}

**Decklist to review:**
{{{decklist}}}

**Your tasks:**
1.  **Provide a \`reviewSummary\`**: Write a comprehensive analysis covering the deck's core strategy, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it fits into the current metagame for the specified format. Assume the provided decklist is legal for the format. Focus on strategic improvements, not rule violations.

2.  **Propose \`deckOptions\`**: Create at least two distinct options for improving the deck. Each option should have a clear strategic focus (e.g., making it better against aggro, or giving it more tools against control). For each option:
    *   Provide a short, descriptive \`title\`.
    *   Provide a detailed \`description\` that explains the strategy behind the changes. DO NOT list the card changes in the description itself.
    *   Provide a \`cardsToAdd\` array with the exact card names and quantities to add.
    *   Provide a \`cardsToRemove\` array with the exact card names and quantities to remove from the original list.
    *   Ensure the card names are spelled correctly. The number of cards added should generally equal the number of cards removed to maintain deck size.`,
