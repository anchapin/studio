### 8. Examples (`examples.ts` - 360 lines)

Nine complete examples demonstrating:

1. **Creating a new game**: Game initialization
2. **Loading decks**: Deck loading and starting hands
3. **Card operations**: Tap, counters, damage, attachment
4. **Zone operations**: Drawing, shuffling, card movement
5. **Turn phases**: Phase advancement and queries
6. **Combat and damage**: Damage dealing and life tracking
7. **Tokens**: Token creation
8. **Priority passing**: Stack and priority system
9. **Full simulation**: Simplified complete game

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Immutable State Updates
All game state functions return new state objects rather than mutating existing ones. This enables:
- Time travel debugging
- Easy undo/redo
- Deterministic multiplayer synchronization
- State serialization for save/load

### 2. Zone ID Convention
Zones use `{playerId}-{zoneType}` pattern:
- `p1-library`, `p2-hand`, `p1-battlefield`
- `stack` for shared stack zone

### 3. Timestamp-Based Ordering
All timestamp-based effects use Unix epoch milliseconds:
- `enteredBattlefieldTimestamp`: For "last in, first out" effects
- `attachedTimestamp`: For attachment ordering

### 4. Type Safety
Complete TypeScript type coverage:
- No `any` types in game-state module
- Strict type checking enabled
- Comprehensive interfaces for all game entities

### 5. Map-Based Collections
Players and cards stored in `Map` for O(1) lookups:
```typescript
players: Map<PlayerId, Player>
cards: Map<CardInstanceId, CardInstance>
```

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Code

1. **Scryfall Integration** (`src/app/actions.ts`)
   - `ScryfallCard` type reused for card data
   - Seamless integration with existing deck builder

2. **Game Rules** (`src/lib/game-rules.ts`)
   - Format rules now include starting life
   - Game state references format rules

3. **AI System** (`src/ai/`)
   - Game state evaluator can analyze complete game states
   - AI flows can make decisions based on state structures

### For Future Features

1. **Phase 1.2 (Card Mechanics)**
   - Ready to implement spell casting
   - Mana pool system in place
   - Combat structures ready

2. **Phase 1.3 (Rules Engine)**
   - Card instance state tracking complete
   - Zone system supports all zone transitions
   - Counter system supports all counter types

3. **Phase 2 (Single Player)**
   - Game state can drive UI rendering
   - Player choice system for interactions
   - Complete turn structure for gameplay flow

4. **Phase 3 (AI Gameplay)**
   - AI can evaluate game states
   - Decision trees can use state snapshots
   - Move generation uses action types

5. **Phase 4 (Multiplayer)**
   - Immutable state enables deterministic sync
   - State serialization for network transmission
   - Action logging for replay/reconciliation

---

## Testing Strategy

While full unit tests were not added in this phase (test framework not configured), the module includes:

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript compiler catches all type errors
2. **Examples**: 9 working examples demonstrating all features
3. **Validation**: Runtime type checking with Zod schemas (existing AI flows)

When test framework is added, test coverage should include:
- Game state creation and initialization
- Card state manipulation
- Zone operations and card movement
- Turn phase advancement
- Priority passing
- State-based actions
- Win condition detection
